The Factory Method Pattern is a creational design pattern that defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

Unlike the simple factory (which uses conditionals inside one class), Factory Method relies on inheritance: the object creation is delegated to subclasses.
